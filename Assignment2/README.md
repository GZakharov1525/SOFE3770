This assignment deals with Pareto optimization algorithm used for
multi-objective optmization problems. We were able to come up with an
algorithm that is **n log n** complex.

- Main problem is done in C++ .
- A python script is used plot the solutions which uses matplot lib

## Dependencies

- **C++11** supported compiler.
- **CGAL** -- For finding the convex hull
- **CMake** -- for building the source code.
- **Python 2.x**
- **Matplot lib for Python** -- for plotting the solutions
